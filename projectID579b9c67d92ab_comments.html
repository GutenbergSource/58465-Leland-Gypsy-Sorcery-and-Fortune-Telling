<HTML><BODY>This curious book includes a number of wonder devilish initials and woodcarvings, by the author, the American Folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland. For the rest, it deals with magical spells and charms used by the Romani people in Southern and Eastern Europe. Be prepared for some foreign words with uncommon accents.

<p>Fans of the Science Fiction books on <i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert might recognize some of the fragments as the "Chakobsa" language used in those books: they have been taken from this book, and are not in the actual Chakobsa language that was used in Dagestan.
